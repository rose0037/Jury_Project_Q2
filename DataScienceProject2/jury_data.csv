Had the plaintiff made the case that they didn't post something to warn everyone about the danger, I might have seen it differently. But only if there is some kind of legal requirement to do so.

If you ride on an old bike, you take the risks associated with that. Old houses often have safety concerns that one must take into account. The defense seem to specify that the adjustments the plaintiff suggested for the stairs weren't possible or economically viable for even the tenants.

Had the landing been there in the first place, she may have never fallen or likely wouldn't have sustained such terrible injuries. However, accidents happen, hence the name accident.
